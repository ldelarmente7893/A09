            Movie Reviews

        <blockquote>
            "Lots of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera version showing the personalities
            of the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened. Even that would not have been so bad
            but the movie tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right thing."
            <br><br>
            "I am watching this for the 2rd time, trying to understand how this large group of capitalist pigs could royally
            screw their families, descendants, neighbors, countrymen, and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no
            compassion."
